Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. Somehow you've stumbled here (surprisingly) and decided to stick around long enough to read my introduction post.

Congratulations.

I'm some kind of developer by day, and a [furry][fur] mouse by night. My travels through computer science began humbly with games like [AT-Robots][robots], continued with a long detour in the C family of languages (C++, then C#, and much later, C itself), then a mostly forgettable jaunt with PHP and Clojure. More recently I've had a very pleasant time with Python, though my passion of the day is, by far, Rust.

Since this seems to be turning into a resume of sorts, I have a bachelors of applied science in software engineering, and have been working in the field professionally for seven years or so.

Some of my abandoned projects include [fursuits.by][builderdb], a review and commission website for fursuitsâ€”insufferably warm mascot-like costumes. Actually that's the only one I've published under this particular brand. Guess I'll have to fix that!
